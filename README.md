# Developer Profile Generator

### Purpose 

A command-line application that dynamically generates a PDF profile from a GitHub username. It is important to have up-to-date information about members of the development team. Rather than navigating to each team member's GitHub profile, a command-line application will allow for quick and easy generation of profiles in PDF format.

### Functionality

Given the user has a GitHub profile - the user will be prompted for the developer's username and favorite color, which will be used as the background color for cards. This will generate a PDF file with following information: 

* Profile image
* User name
* Links to the following:
  * User location via Google Maps
  * User GitHub profile
  * User blog
* User bio
* Number of public repositories
* Number of followers
* Number of GitHub stars
* Number of users following
